<h2>Artist Statement</h2>

<p>
Would you like to live forever? Too bad, you will. This is the same fate that piles of scrap find when I get my hands on them. I salvage them into new beings and then I promptly discard them, and I will inevitably start hating them as if I am the vile Viktor Frankenstein. These pieces of discarded metal have lived their lives, finished their stories, and wound up in the scrap bin. This “death” acted more as the reboot that Don Hertzfeldt said was “unappealing” to all. This same cycle of becoming, being, and “rebooting” that I do with my sculptures is the same as our cycle you will and have faced. <br>You are the apple that is in that glass box Anthony Aguirre was talking about. You are doomed to rot and then decay until you return as the energy, the scrap, that has once became all of our matter in the big bang. You will then become everything you can and ever will until you inevitably return as you are now. You are to be reflected in that rusted metallic color of my steel children. My steel children that are fumbling through their new life as abstract humans that I birthed through the welder, the children that I formed through the hammer. The children who will return to scrap are being viewed by the people who will return to energy.
